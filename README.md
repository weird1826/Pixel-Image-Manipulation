# Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption
- A Python implementation for altering images by manipulating their pixels
- Supports both encryption and decryption
- The current implementation only supports PNG and JPG/JPEG images
- Has two modes for encryption (Both are almost identical, but handles the operations on pixels differently and gives different outputs as well)
- Has the feature to generate an encryption key in a JSON file format for each encryption done
- Tried to implement error handling for directories and file formats wherever possible
